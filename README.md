# eBay University Challenge 2024

Welcome to the **Edgerunners** team repository for the **eBay University Hiring Challenge 2024**! ðŸš€

## **Overview**

This repository captures the work we did as part of eBay's University Hiring Challenge, where we took on the exciting task of solving a large-scale entity extraction problem in the e-commerce domain. While we didnâ€™t make it all the way to the top, weâ€™re proud of finishing in the **Top 7** globally and learning a ton along the way.

## **Key Highlights**

-   Fine-tuned **Llama 3.1 with LoRA** to match car models from a dataset of **5 million automobile part records** in the **Year-Make-Model** format.
-   Handled **300GB of data**, exploring scalable preprocessing pipelines and efficient workflows.
-   Built a **distributed inference system** across **16 A100 GPUs**, cutting inference time down to **23 hours** from an initial 10 days on a single GPU.
-   Used **entropy-based sampling** to refine predictions, boosting the **F0.2 score** from **0.49 to 0.62**.
-   Experimented with high-performance computing (HPC) and multi-GPU setups, applying industry-standard ML practices.
